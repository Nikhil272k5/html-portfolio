<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Nikhil</strong>, and I’m a 20-year-old aspiring web developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at <strong>VIT-AP University</strong>. I have a strong passion for technology and love turning ideas into real, functional digital experiences.</p>

<p>My primary interest lies in <strong>web development</strong>, where I enjoy building modern, responsive, and interactive websites. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I’ve also started working with frameworks like React and backend tools like Node.js. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to expand my full-stack development skills.</p>

<p>In the AI/ML domain, I’ve worked on small projects involving data preprocessing, predictive models, and neural networks. I'm fascinated by how intelligent systems work and how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>At VIT-AP, I’ve been actively involved in project work, coding contests, and technical clubs, where I get to collaborate with peers and improve my problem-solving skills. I’ve also contributed to open-source projects and continue to explore new opportunities in both academic and real-world applications.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I have a deep love for films, especially those that make you think, and I enjoy writing about my favorite movies and characters. I believe creativity and technology go hand in hand, and I’m always looking to bring a personal, meaningful touch to everything I build.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and contribute to impactful projects in the fields of web technology and artificial intelligence. I’m currently seeking opportunities for internships, collaborations, and learning experiences that can help me grow both personally and professionally.</p>
